# Motivations


The aim of this macro is to stich together tiles generated by the CorrSight spinning disk microscope and save them into a single file. Works on XYZCT acquisition, not tested on anything else.

## How to install

To install, drop the file in `Fiji.app>macros>toolsets` folder. Restart Fiji and the macro name will then appear under the **>>** menu on the right hand side of Fiji bar.

## Requirements

No additional plugins are required.

## How to use

To activate the macro, find it under the **>>** menu on the right hand side of Fiji bar. Two buttons should appear on the Fiji bar. 
<br>The first button will generate invidual stack for individual tiles by making XYZCT hyperstack based on all files in a folder.
<br>The second button will then stitch the individual tiles together and save the files.
